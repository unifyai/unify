"""Single source of truth for Console / platform UI terminology.

Every prompt that describes the Unify Console web app — its panels, tabs,
menus, routes, click paths, integration/secret affordances, onboarding flow,
and screen-share/desktop controls — sources its vocabulary and its longer
descriptive blocks from this module. Centralizing the facts here keeps the
prompts from drifting as the product UI evolves: when a surface is renamed or
moved, it is corrected once here rather than in every manager prompt.

The contents are kept in sync with the live Console source at
``/Users/djl11/console`` and describe only what currently renders. Atomic,
unlikely-to-drift phrases (e.g. "screen share") may still be written inline in
the prompts; this module owns the structural, high-drift terminology.
