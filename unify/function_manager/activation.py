"""Query-time activation for the stored-function library.

A function's standing in the library is not a curator's verdict but a
memory trace: every use strengthens it, disuse decays it, and retrieval
ranks on similarity *and* standing — the way a colleague's own procedures
come to mind. Three properties fall out, and they are the design:

* **Deletion is unnecessary for hygiene.** What a crowded library costs is
  scope — search slots, schema surface, attention — not storage. A function
  whose activation has decayed below the scope threshold stops surfacing
  (and stops costing anything) while its row remains, so a revival is a
  lookup rather than a re-derivation. Nothing here mutates rows on a
  timer: activation is computed at query time from the usage trace, so
  "dropping out of scope" is passive arithmetic, not a background job.

* **Creation is an activation event** (the newborn grace). A brand-new
  function has no usage; if standing counted only calls, novelty would be
  a death spiral — never surfaced, never called, decayed. Storing the
  function IS its first use, giving it a window to earn its second.

* **Decay is relative to each function's own rhythm.** A single global
  half-life murders the quarterly-report function every quarter. Here the
  decay clock scales with the median interval between a function's own
  uses: a skill exercised every 90 days is still "recent" at day 60,
  while a daily skill dormant for a month has plainly lapsed.

Every number lives in :class:`ActivationSettings` — a decision, never a
call-site constant. Ranking caps the activation term (``similarity_floor``)
so semantic similarity dominates and standing acts as the tiebreaker;
without the cap, usage-weighted retrieval feeds usage counts and an
entrenched mediocre function shadows a better newcomer forever. The other
half of that guard lives in the supersede path, which transfers the old
function's usage trace to its replacement, so an upgrade inherits standing
instead of restarting the popularity contest from zero.

    """Knobs for the memory-trace arithmetic.

    Attributes:
        similarity_floor: Fraction of the ranking score that similarity
            keeps regardless of standing. 0.7 means activation can swing at
            most 30% of the score — a tiebreaker, never the headline.
        newborn_floor: Activation a freshly created, never-called function
            holds while its creation is still "recent" — the grace that
            lets novelty surface long enough to earn a first call.
        strength_saturation_calls: Call count at which usage strength
            saturates; log-scaled below it, flat above.
        rhythm_default_days: Decay clock for functions with fewer than two
            calls (no observable rhythm yet).
        rhythm_min_days / rhythm_max_days: Clamp on the observed median
            inter-use interval, so one burst or one long gap cannot set a
            pathological clock.
        rhythm_slack: Multiplier on the rhythm before decay bites — 3.0
            means a function is at ~e⁻¹ standing after three of its own
            typical intervals without use.
        scope_threshold: Activation below which a function stops surfacing
            in search (out of scope). Its row persists; explicit lookups
            and dormant-inclusive searches still reach it.
        recent_calls_kept: How many recent call timestamps the usage trace
            retains for rhythm estimation (the total count is unbounded).
