# ── Handles ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod


class SteerableToolHandle(ABC):
    """Abstract base class for steerable tool handles.

    Defines the full steering surface: query (``ask``, ``interject``),
    lifecycle (``stop``, ``pause``, ``resume``), completion (``done``,
    ``result``), and event APIs (``next_clarification``,
    ``next_notification``, ``answer_clarification``).

    Context parameters
    ------------------
    Steering methods accept plumbing parameters that are hidden from LLM tool
    schemas by their underscore prefix and injected by orchestrating code:

    - ``_parent_chat_context_cont`` (for ``interject``): continuation of the
      parent conversation since this loop started, injected into the ongoing
      conversation as an incremental update.

    - ``_parent_chat_context`` (for ``ask``): full context snapshot for the
      fresh inspection loop ``ask`` spawns, injected according to the LLM's
      ``include_parent_chat_context`` choice.

    Signature extension contract
    ----------------------------
    Derived classes may extend any steering method signature with additional
    keyword arguments specific to their domain. The signatures defined here
    are the minimum universal contract every handle accepts, so callers that
    hold a reference typed as ``SteerableToolHandle`` may safely pass only
    these base parameters.

    When dispatching a steering call to a handle whose concrete type is
    unknown, use ``forward_handle_call`` (from
    ``unify.common._async_tool.messages``): it introspects the target
    method's signature, filters out kwargs the target does not accept, and
    applies positional fallbacks.

    """
    Run ``async_tool_loop_inner`` in its own task and return a handle for
    live interaction.

    Parameters
    ----------
    log_steps : bool | str, default True
        Controls verbosity of step logging to `LOGGER`:
          - False: no logging
          - True: log everything except system messages
          - "full": log everything including system messages

    timeout : int | None, default None
        Activity-based timeout in seconds. When ``None`` (default), no
        timeout is enforced.

    raise_on_limit : bool, default False
        If ``True``, raises ``asyncio.TimeoutError`` or ``RuntimeError``
        when the timeout or max_steps limit is exceeded. If ``False``,
        the loop terminates gracefully with a summary message.

    interrupt_llm_on_tool_completion : bool, default True
        Whether a background tool finishing mid-reasoning cancels the in-flight
        LLM step so the next one starts with that result. Keeping this ``True``
        is what guarantees the model never reasons on stale context.

        Set it ``False`` only for loops that fan out to many short tools whose
        completions are staggered: there, each completion kills a reasoning step
        the provider has already billed, so a batch of N tools discards up to
        N-1 paid steps. With it ``False`` the step is allowed to finish and be
        used, and the tool result reaches the model on the following turn
        instead. That trades a turn of freshness for the cost of the step, which
        is only worth it where nobody is waiting on the latency.

    persist : bool, default False
        If ``True``, the loop does not terminate when the LLM produces content
        without tool calls. Instead, it blocks waiting for the next interjection
        via ``handle.interject()``. When an interjection arrives, the LLM is
        granted another turn. This enables a single persistent loop that can
        process multiple events over time. The loop only terminates when
        explicitly stopped via ``handle.stop()`` or cancelled.

    multi_handle : bool, default False
        If ``True``, enables multi-handle mode where the loop can serve multiple
        concurrent requests. Each request is identified by a request_id, and the
        LLM uses ``final_answer(request_id, answer)`` to complete specific requests.
        The returned handle supports ``add_request(message)`` to add new requests
        to the running loop. Interjections are tagged with request IDs so the LLM
        knows which request they belong to. The loop terminates when all requests
        are completed/cancelled (unless persist=True).

    time_awareness : bool, default True
        If ``True``, a time-context system message is injected into the
        conversation and updated after each tool completion, giving the LLM
        awareness of wall-clock time and tool execution durations.  If
        ``False``, the time-context table is omitted entirely.
