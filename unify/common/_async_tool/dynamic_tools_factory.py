STEER_DOC = """Steer a currently-tracked call: stop it, interject guidance, pause/resume it, \
answer a pending clarification, invoke a custom method on its handle, or ask a read-only \
question about its live progress.

`call_id` is the id shown on the original tool call that launched the work (the same id \
that later appears on its `check_status`/progress/clarification tail messages). This tool \
is always available — if `call_id` no longer refers to a live, in-flight call (it already \
finished, or never existed), you get back an instructive error instead of a schema change.

Parameters
----------
call_id : str
    The id of the call to steer (see above).
action : "stop" | "interject" | "pause" | "resume" | "clarify" | "call" | "ask"
    stop      - Cancel the call. `payload` may carry an optional reason.
    interject - Inject additional guidance while the call keeps running.
                `payload` is the guidance text.
    pause     - Pause the call. Fails with an instructive error if it is already paused.
    resume    - Resume a paused call. Fails with an instructive error if it is not paused.
    clarify   - Answer a clarification the call is blocked on. `payload` is the answer text.
                Only valid while that call is actually waiting on a clarification.
    call      - Invoke a custom method the call's handle exposes beyond the core steering
                surface above. `method` names the method; `payload` is a JSON **object**
                string of keyword arguments matched against that method's real signature.
                Blocking: you get the method's return value once it completes, same as
                waiting on any other tool.
    ask       - Ask a read-only question about a call that is still running, to understand
                its live progress or intermediate reasoning without stopping it. `payload`
                is the question. Blocking: spins up a nested inspection turn and returns a
                short answer. Intended for a call that is still running; once it has
                completed, prefer `ask_about_completed_tool` instead (a different id
                namespace is not needed; the same call_id applies there too) — its
                docstring never changes, so it is the more idiomatic choice for
                retrospective questions. A call that finishes in the narrow window
                between you deciding to steer it and this executing still gets a
                coherent answer either way: this resolves to the same completed-run
                answer `ask_about_completed_tool` would have given.
payload : str | None
    Action-specific content — see above. Omit when the action does not need one
    (stop's reason, pause, resume).
method : str | None
    Required only for action="call": the name of the custom method to invoke.
include_parent_context : bool
    Relevant for action="ask" and action="interject". For "ask", whether to
    pass the parent conversation's context into the nested inspection turn —
    off by default; set true only when the question depends on conversation
    specifics you cannot restate compactly in the payload. For "interject",
    whether to forward the parent conversation's continuation context
    alongside the guidance text — on by default, and only takes effect if
    the target call originally opted into context propagation. Ignored by
    every other action.

Returns
-------
A status acknowledgement, or (for "call"/"ask") the underlying result once it completes.
