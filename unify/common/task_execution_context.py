"""
Pure plumbing for **run-scoped task execution delegation**.

This module introduces a small abstraction that allows code that *starts* task
execution (e.g., `TaskScheduler.execute`) to delegate that execution to the
current run's execution environment without explicitly threading parameters
through every call site.

Why this exists
---------------
A single "topmost" execution environment (often an Actor-like
orchestrator) may need to:

- trigger durable task execution via TaskScheduler, and
- ensure that the task is executed *through the same environment* (rather than
  spawning a fresh one).

This is a cyclic routing problem:

    execution environment → TaskScheduler → (delegate back to) execution environment

`ContextVar` is used throughout the repo to propagate async context safely.
Here, it enables run-scoped delegation:

- **Run-scoped**: a delegate is set at the top of an async execution context and
  reset in a `finally` block. The delegate owns how the task run is contained
  inside that environment, such as starting a child actor run for one task.
- **Async-safe**: `ContextVar` propagation ensures each async task tree sees the
  correct delegate under concurrency.
- **No leakage**: callers must reset to prevent delegates persisting across runs.

Correct usage pattern
---------------------
Set the delegate at the start of an async run, and always reset it:

```python
token = current_task_execution_delegate.set(delegate)
try:
    # ... run logic that may call into TaskScheduler ...
finally:
    current_task_execution_delegate.reset(token)
```

Anti-patterns
-------------
- Setting the delegate in `__init__` (async context is not established yet).
- Forgetting to reset in a `finally` block (causes cross-run leakage).
- Relying on the delegate outside an async execution context (undefined).

class TaskExecutionDelegate(Protocol):
    """Protocol for delegating task execution to a run-scoped execution environment.

    Contract
    --------
    - Implementations must be run-scoped: set at the start of an execution context
      and reset in a `finally` block to prevent leakage.
    - Safe under async concurrency: `ContextVar` propagation ensures each async
      task tree gets its own delegate instance.
    - Must not leak across runs: after a run completes, the delegate must be `None`
      in fresh async contexts.

    Usage
    -----
    This protocol is used by task execution routing to run tasks through the
    execution environment that initiated the task while preserving one task run
    per returned handle.
