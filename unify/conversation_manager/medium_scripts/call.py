# Sentence-level timings for the coordinator onboarding intro (walkie + clean).
# Boundaries were derived from the original per-sentence audio slices aligned via
# Whisper word timestamps; playback uses one continuous recording with TimedString
# chunks so LiveKit can commit only the heard prefix on interruption.
#
# ``twin-onboarding-intro.mp3`` is spliced from the original recording:
#   1. Part A: trim 0→18.35s (through "Much better." + natural silence).
#   2. Part B: trim 20.77→21.27s (0.5s natural silence before unmute in the
#      source) concat 21.27s→end ("By the way…") — one continuous part B.
#   3. Concat part A + part B once with a 2ms ``acrossfade`` at that join.
# Extra pause comes from prefixing part B, not from padding part A or adding a
# third segment after "Much better." — those extra joins caused the blip.
# The "Any questions…" block (≈18.36–20.76s) stays removed.
# Radio static-removal SFX (≈16.65–16.95s intro, ≈2.05–3.85s bridge) is
# level-matched on ``twin-onboarding-intro.mp3`` and
# ``twin-onboarding-static-bridge.mp3`` (~8× intro, ~⅙ bridge).
