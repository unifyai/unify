"""Coordinator onboarding narration handlers.

Symmetric with ``inactivity`` for ``InactivityFollowup``: parses the
``unity_system_event`` payload that orchestra publishes whenever a
real user action lands during Coordinator onboarding (workspace
OAuth, integration connect, or session start from the picker) and
surfaces the request to the brain as a notification so it
composes a short acknowledgement turn.

We deliberately keep the handler dumb: the brain decides the wording
based on the system-prompt rule injected in
``prompt_builders.build_system_prompt`` for ``is_coordinator``
sessions. The notification we push here carries only the structured
event payload + a one-line system instruction; the brain owns the
phrasing.

Gating on ``Coordinator/State.onboarding_active`` happens on the
orchestra side before the event is ever published, so handlers here
can assume the user is currently in the onboarding flow. Outside of
onboarding the helper simply never runs.
