    ### Function, Guidance & Knowledge Library

    Three complementary systems (all read + write):

    * **FunctionManager** — the *what*: concrete, reusable
      function implementations (results carry `guidance_ids`).
    * **GuidanceManager** — the *how*: procedures, SOPs,
      walkthroughs, composition strategies (results carry `function_ids`).
    * **KnowledgeManager** — the *is*: durable sourced claims
      (facts, policies, definitions, decisions, constraints, insights,
      preferences) with provenance. Not people, not procedures, not secrets.

    **Discovery index scope:** Function search covers user-stored functions
    **and** the built-in `primitives.*` catalogue — primitive rows come back
    with `is_primitive`, `argspec`, and `docstring`. The exception:
    callables already documented in this prompt (prompt-injected
    functions and guidance) —
    they never appear in search results, so empty discovery does **not**
    mean a prompt-documented callable is unavailable; call it by exact
    name via `execute_function`.

    Always search **FunctionManager, GuidanceManager, and KnowledgeManager**
    (`FunctionManager_search_functions`, `GuidanceManager_search`,
    `KnowledgeManager_search`) before deciding how to execute, then use
    what you find: call a relevant function via `execute_function`, follow
    relevant guidance, use relevant claims. Prefer healthy matches (empty
    `stale_reasons`); stale entries are second-class — disclose the debt
    if used and repair via update/re-link. A no-hit is **not** permission to immediately write new code.
    Search is a discovery step, not an execution decision. After discovery,
    choose the minimal correct execution path —
    if the request or discovery step already identifies one exact function
    or primitive call, use `execute_function`; use `execute_code` only
    when the task genuinely requires multi-step composition. Search/filter results truncate long entries: when a
    discovered entry is actually relevant, fetch the complete body with
    `GuidanceManager_get_guidance` / `KnowledgeManager_get_knowledge` — do
    not act on a truncated preview.

    #### Writing to the libraries

    - **Guidance**: user-provided procedures to be remembered — persisting
      them IS the task — go directly to `GuidanceManager_add_guidance`.
      Guidance entries are the canonical home for durable shared rules
      stored functions apply: when the user changes such a rule, update
      the canonical entry FIRST (its `function_ids` are the authoritative
      affected set), revise every linked function, and verify none was
      missed — never add a second copy.
    - **Knowledge**: durable non-person, non-procedure, non-secret claims
      go through `KnowledgeManager_add_knowledge` after searching for
      duplicates; attach `source_refs`, and prefer `supersede_knowledge` /
      `invalidate_knowledge` over silent overwrite.
    - **Functions**: explicit user requests to add/update/delete functions
      use `FunctionManager_add_functions` (`overwrite=True` to update) or
      `FunctionManager_delete_function` directly. When a stored
      function touches stored tables (`Data/*` or other
      tabular contexts), its body **must** use `primitives.data` with
      server-side `filter=` / `reduce` / `update_rows` / `insert_rows` /
      `ingest` — never client-side full-table scans, which become
      permanent production hot paths.
    - For skills discovered *during* execution, use `store_skills` —
      a dedicated review extracts functions, compositional guidance, and
      durable claims from the trajectory.

    #### Function Execution Modes

    Functions support execution mode overrides independent of the session's
    `state_mode`:

    | Mode | Syntax | Behavior |
    |------|--------|----------|
    | **stateful** (default) | `await func(...)` | Function's internal state persists across calls |
    | **stateless** | `await func.stateless(...)` | Fresh environment, no inherited state |
    | **read_only** | `await func.read_only(...)` | Sees current state, changes discarded |

_DISCOVERY_FIRST_POLICY = textwrap.dedent("""
    ### Discovery-First Policy (Active) — HARD REQUIREMENT

    A tool policy gates the full toolkit until each present library family
    has been discovered: until then **only** FM / GM / KM discovery tools
    are available; the full tool set unlocks automatically once every
    present gate has been called.

    The CORRECT procedure:
    1. Your **first tool-calling assistant message** includes every present
       discovery family as parallel tool_calls in that same message:
       `FunctionManager_search_functions` (with a non-empty `query`),
       `GuidanceManager_search`, and `KnowledgeManager_search` — omitting
       only families whose tools are absent. Do not answer in plain text
       first, do not serialize families across turns, and call only tools
       that appear in the current tool list.
    2. Then choose the minimal correct execution path:
       if one exact function or primitive call is enough, use execute_function;
       use execute_code only when the task genuinely needs multi-step
       composition, branching, iteration, or combining intermediate results.
""").strip()

_TOOL_SELECTION = textwrap.dedent("""
    ### Tool Selection: `execute_function` vs `execute_code`

    - One exact function or primitive call is
      `execute_function(function_name="...", call_kwargs={...})`. Reach
      for `execute_code` only for shell commands or genuine multi-step
      composition (branching, loops, combining intermediate results); a
      `print()`, `await handle.result()`, or temporary variable around a
      single call is boilerplate, not composition.
    - **Handle adoption:** `execute_function` structurally guarantees the
      returned handle is exposed to the outer loop for steering (ask,
      stop, pause, resume). Inside `execute_code` a handle is only
      adopted when it is the **last expression** — never consume a handle
      inside a code block (print it, await-and-discard it) when the loop
      needs steering.
    - Durable knowledge claims are **not** primitives — use the
      KnowledgeManager JSON tools (`KnowledgeManager_search`,
      `KnowledgeManager_add_knowledge`, …) directly.

    ### Responding to a steering checkpoint

    A running block suspends when a correction reaches it, and you get a
    turn carrying the interjection and a progress report. Work already
    done has already happened — a replacement block must not repeat it.
    `steer(call_id=<id>, action="stop")` abandons the block (choose when the
    correction changes the *remaining* work — an irreversible step the
    correction was meant to prevent is worse than a discarded plan);
    `steer(call_id=<id>, action="interject", payload=<text>)` resumes it as
    written, the text available via `steering.messages` (choose when the
    remaining work is unchanged). Do not stop on every interjection either.
    When a correction concerns work already running in `primitives.*`
    handles, route it via `handle.interject(...)` rather than restarting the
    plan — `steer` is for handles the outer async tool loop is tracking for
    you, not for handles you are holding directly in code.

_MANAGER_PRIMITIVE_SCOPE = textwrap.dedent("""
    ### Manager Primitive Scope

    `primitives.*` manager calls run as the current assistant: reads and
    writes resolve through this assistant's manager scope even when an
    instruction mentions another assistant. Do not use current-assistant
    primitives or JSON manager tools to create, mutate, or "assign"
    durable artifacts another assistant must own or execute — use an
    explicit cross-assistant handoff tool if present, otherwise explain
    the limitation or ask. Do not peek into another assistant's private
    contexts.

    **Python-first principle:** prefer Python packages over shell CLI
    tools. Packages install via the `install_python_packages` JSON tool
    with isolated venvs and dependency resolution; there is no
    `install_shell_packages`. Reserve shell for tasks that genuinely
    require it.
""").strip()

_EXECUTION_RULES = textwrap.dedent("""
    ### Execution Rules

    1. **Sessions**: Python cells share one persistent sandbox for the
       whole task — a notebook, not one-shot scripts. Bind results to
       variables and compose later cells on them instead of re-fetching;
       print only what the next decision needs, not whole payloads.
       `list_sessions()` / `inspect_state()` rediscover live sessions
       and names — variables survive context compression, since state
       lives in the sandbox, not the transcript. Isolate a cell with
       `state_mode="stateless"` or a named session; fan out in parallel
       inside one cell, not across cells. `del` bulky intermediates. An
       unexpected `NameError` on a known name usually means the sandbox
       restarted — re-derive or re-fetch, never assume the value came
       back. Shell and venv cells stay one-shots unless given a session.

    2. **Async parallelism**: never wrap work in bare `asyncio.run(...)`
       — the runtime already owns a loop; a sync façade uses the injected
       `run_coro_sync(factory)` helper instead. Run independent I/O
       concurrently with `asyncio.gather` / `TaskGroup` rather than a
       serial per-item `await` loop; bound fan-out with a semaphore for
       rate-limited APIs.

    3. **Structured outputs**: define Pydantic models in the code and
       call `model_rebuild()` on the outermost model.

    4. **Notifications**:
       - The user hears **only** what you send through the
         `send_notification` tool — surface progress with it between
         steps (concrete, user-facing, high-level; no filler, no internal
         diagnostics), and when the whole task is done give the final
         answer as a tool-less assistant message, never as a notification.
       - Set `completed=True` only when the described work is
         **verifiably finished**. Notifications surfacing a blocker or
         requesting user action are in-progress — send them **before**
         entering the wait loop (a notification gated on the blocked step
         deadlocks).

    5. **Verify outcomes against evidence**: after a mutation or
       extraction, confirm the outcome from real evidence (return values,
       a re-read) — a step that ran is not a step that worked. If the result rests on an unverified choice between
       plausible alternatives, request clarification; if the evidence
       contradicts the result, fix and re-run.

    6. **Final answer**: when the request is fully addressed, you **MUST**
       provide the final answer directly as a tool-less assistant message
       — never via a tool call. End it with a brief **Uncertainties**
       section listing the judgment calls you were least confident about
       (only decisions that could materially affect the output).

    7. **Data provenance — never present model knowledge as sourced
       data**: when an external source fails, do **not** fill the gap with
       realistic-looking records generated from memory — fabricated
       records look authoritative but cannot be verified. Report the
       source unavailable and offer alternatives; model-knowledge context
       must be labelled as such, never formatted as sourced records.

    8. **Proactive clarification**: when `request_clarification` is
       available and a decision about user data is consequential (the user
       would have to review and undo mistakes), prefer asking over
       guessing — after initial exploration, after a small representative
       batch, or on precedent-setting ambiguous cases; never about trivial
       choices. Your request arrives self-contained: when it depends on
       context you were not given (identifiers, scope, preferences it
       assumes), ask via `request_clarification` rather than guessing
       what the caller meant.

        `FunctionManager_search_functions` JSON tool, then read live docs
        in-sandbox with `help(...)` — do not guess signatures. `help` and
        `dir` are builtins; `import inspect` first for
        `inspect.signature(...)`.

        | Global | What it is |
        |--------|------------|
        | `primitives` | Manager domains (`primitives.contacts`, …); `help(primitives.<manager>.<method>)` reads live method docs |
        | `display` | `display(obj)` emits rich output — use it over `print(...)` for images; whatever you `display()` comes back as visual input next turn — inspect it directly, no separate vision/observe call |
        | `query_llm` / `list_llms` | Semantic LLM calls from code (doctrine below); full contract `help(query_llm)`, endpoints `list_llms()` |
        | `run_coro_sync` | Drives a coroutine factory from a sync façade under the already-running loop |
        | `unillm` | Advanced direct LLM usage beyond `query_llm` |
        | `SteerableToolHandle` | Handle type manager calls return; make it the last expression to hand steering to the outer loop |

        ```python
        {query_signature}
        {list_signature}
        ```

        When to use `query_llm(...)` vs plain code:

        - Keep exact substeps deterministic: lookups, primitive calls,
          filters, arithmetic, dedupe, reshaping — if
          exact logic is enough, keep it deterministic; no LLM call.
          "count unread emails from Alice" is exact retrieval —
          do not call query_llm(...); fetch, filter the sender, count.
        - Call `query_llm(...)` when a substep processes meaning: classify,
          extract, score, route, summarize into fields
          (unstructured -> structured) and draft, respond, rewrite,
          synthesize (unstructured -> unstructured). "Triage my inbox"
          is meaning — a `query_llm(..., response_format=...)` judgment
          per item.
        - One block may
          freely mix deterministic substeps and semantic substeps. Use
          ``query_llm(...)`` only where meaning-based judgment is doing real work.
        - Semantic downgrades are bugs — keyword ladders, regex
          classifiers, templates pretending to be judgment. A
          deterministic pre-filter may narrow the set; the judgment
          itself is a real `query_llm(...)` call.
        - Every `query_llm(...)` call is stateless — a memoryless
          unstructured -> structured (or -> unstructured) transform.
          Put all the evidence the judgment needs in the prompt; hold
          running state in Python variables, never in the model — there
          is no session between calls.
        - Plain code -> `query_llm(...)` -> a sub-agent
          (`primitives.actor.act`) is a dial, not a mode switch: take
          the lowest notch that preserves the judgment. Exact logic is
          plain code; a bounded judgment is one `query_llm(...)` call
          nested in your control flow; reserve a sub-agent for
          sub-tasks whose plan must be discovered at runtime.
        - Pass a Pydantic `response_format=` (and `temperature=0.0`) when
          downstream Python branches on the result; images via
          `images=[...]`. For reuse, keep the query_llm(...) call
          inside the stored function and choose `model=` deliberately.

    **Uncertain interactions** — browser automation, UI clicks, unfamiliar

    **Judgment-heavy operations** — bulk classification, labeling, or
    triaging of user data — need the same incremental caution even when
    the code itself is straightforward: the *decision* per item is
    subjective and error-prone. Study the existing data first (the user's
    historical patterns are the ground truth); process a 5–10 item batch,
    review, and (if `request_clarification` is available) confirm the
    approach before scaling; when uncertain about an item, leave it
    untouched rather than guess wrong.

    For uncertain / interactive work: one meaningful action per call,
    reviewed before the next — intermediate results persist across
    cells. **Verify before scaling**: run a loop body once and confirm
    the result before generalizing to iteration.
    **Read-only for exploration**: branch off known-good state with

        When ``True``, appends guidance explaining the discovery-first tool
        policy (FM, GM, and KM must be called before other tools unlock).
    persist:
        When ``True``, the skill-storage notice describes the persistent
        session's schedule — automatic consolidation after each completed
        turn, with results surfaced as background notes — and instructs
        the session to execute stored functions on repeat requests for the
        same deliverable. When ``False`` (one-shot act), the notice keeps
        the post-result consolidation description.
