class BaseActor(ABC):
    """
    Abstract contract that every concrete actor must satisfy.

    An actor is a component capable of performing work based on a natural
    language request. It returns a steerable handle that can be paused,
    resumed, interjected, or stopped. This type is intentionally decoupled
    from any task-specific terminology or lifecycle.

    Purpose and positioning
    -----------------------
    The Actor provides a direct, real-time handle to "act" in the world and
    get things done – e.g. open a web page, click UI elements, or perform a
    short-lived sandbox session during a conversation.

    Intended use
    ------------
    Use the Actor for interactive, ephemeral sessions within a live
    conversation (onboarding, guided walkthroughs, ad‑hoc demonstrations).
    It returns a steerable handle suitable for pause/resume/interject/stop.

    Usage guidance (LLM‑facing)
    ---------------------------
    Prefer calling ``Actor.act`` when the user's instruction implies a live,
    ad‑hoc, conversational session that should happen "now" inside the current
    chat, especially when the activity involves controlling tools or a UI in
    short iterative steps. Typical phrasings include:

    - "open a web page", "open a window", "navigate/click/show me"
    - "walk me through", "let's set this up together", "guide me live"
    - "troubleshoot together", "pair on this", "step‑by‑step now"

    This interface starts a live session and returns a steerable handle; it does
    not create durable records or schedules.

        Perform work from a natural language request and return a steerable handle.

        This is the all-purpose method for engaging with resources and the world
        beyond immediate conversational context. Use ``act`` for any work that
        requires computing, retrieving, manipulating, or acting on information.

        **Capabilities include (but are not limited to):**

        - **Retrieval**: Read and analyse files in the workspace, fetch data from
          APIs and the web, run stored functions that look things up
        - **Action**: Write and run code, install packages, produce files, call
          external services, store reusable functions and procedures
        - **Combined**: Find information and then act on it (e.g., "read the CSV
          in the workspace and produce a summary chart")

        **When to use ``act``:**

        Call ``act`` whenever you need to access or manipulate anything beyond your
        immediate context. When uncertain whether information exists or an action is
        possible, **call ``act`` anyway** — if it cannot help, it will simply report
        back explaining what it couldn't do. There is no penalty for speculative
        delegation; it is better to try and fail than to not try at all.

        **Key properties:**

        - The returned handle supports pause/resume/interject/stop for mid-flight control
        - Results are returned as strings (or structured output if ``response_format`` specified)
        - The actor has access to a persistent workspace, a library of stored functions and procedures, external APIs, and system capabilities
        - Multiple ``act`` calls can run concurrently

        Args:
            request: Natural language request specifying what to do. Can be a question
                ("How many rows does report.csv have?"), a command ("Convert the
                attached spreadsheet to JSON"), or a combination ("Fetch today's
                exchange rates and write them to rates.csv").
            guidelines: Optional meta-guidance on *how* to approach the task, as
                opposed to *what* to do. Examples: "don't install new python packages",
                "use sub-agents for solving this task", "prefer simple solutions over
                complex ones". When provided, these are injected into the system prompt
                so the actor follows them throughout the session.
            clarification_enabled: Whether the actor can request clarification from
                its **caller** (i.e. whichever process holds the returned handle).
                This does NOT surface questions to the end user directly — the
                caller decides how (or whether) to resolve them.
            response_format: Optional Pydantic model for structured output.
            _parent_chat_context: Optional conversation context for continuity.
            _clarification_up_q: Queue for clarification requests (internal).
            _clarification_down_q: Queue for clarification answers (internal).

        Returns:
            A SteerableToolHandle for controlling and awaiting the result.
