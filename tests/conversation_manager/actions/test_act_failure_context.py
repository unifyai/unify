================================================================

When an act() call fails (e.g. the LLM API rejects a request because an
image in the tool result exceeds the provider's per-image size limit), the
ConversationManager should include context about the failure in the *next*
act() request so the actor can avoid the same approach.

Production failure (2026-03-11): display(img) produced a 13 MB base64 PNG
that exceeded Anthropic's 5 MB per-image limit.  The actor's tool loop
crashed on the LLM inference call (not a tool call), and the exception
propagated through AsyncToolLoopHandle.result().

_StorageCheckHandle._run_lifecycle() now captures the exception and
surfaces it as the result string (previously it was swallowed by a bare
``except Exception: pass``).  actor_watch_result detects "Error" in the
result and publishes ActorResult(success=False).  The CM should then
include this failure context in the next act() request.
