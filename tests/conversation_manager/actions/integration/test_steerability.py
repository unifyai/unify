"""
Steerability ConversationManager → CodeActActor integration tests.

These validate the core SteerableToolHandle contract as exercised through CM:
- pause/resume
- stop
- interject
- steering isolation when multiple handles are in-flight

All steering is driven by realistic user messages through step_until_wait,
so the CM brain sees conversational provenance for every state mutation.
