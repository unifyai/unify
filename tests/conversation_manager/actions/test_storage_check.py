=========================================================

Tests that verify the ConversationManager brain correctly handles
``_StorageCheckHandle``-wrapped actor handles where ``result()``
resolves after the task phase (Phase 1), while storage runs in the
background (Phase 2).

With early-resolving ``result()``, the CM receives a single
``ActorResult`` event when the task completes.  The brain should
relay the result to the user.  Storage runs concurrently in the
background — the handle remains live (``done()`` returns ``False``)
but no second wake-up occurs.
