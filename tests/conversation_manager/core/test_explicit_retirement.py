tests/conversation_manager/core/test_explicit_retirement.py
===========================================================

An explicit shutdown is a retirement.

When the process is told to retire (``stop_async``, a benchmark scenario
ending, a sandbox exiting), the session must retire in seconds: run the
``_request_shutdown`` sequence, discard in-flight actions rather than waiting
on them, and return. A fresh boot over the same durable world — in the same
process — must not block on anything the previous instance left behind: not
a parked persist session, not a lock a frozen task still holds on a dead
event loop.

These tests cover the "asked to shut down" path plus the reboot shape the
colleague benchmark runs (teardown-plus-boot between weekly scenarios), where
a retirement that waits on parked work stalls for whatever outer timeout
happens to fire — 600s step ceilings, 900s drains — while a rebooted week
sits idle.
