=====================================================

Tests that verify ConversationManager publishes events to the EventBus
for observability.

ConversationManager publishes Comms events (UnifyMessageReceived,
UnifyMessageSent) as it processes the chat.

These tests verify that:
1. Inbound events (UnifyMessageReceived) are logged to EventBus
2. Outbound events (UnifyMessageSent) are logged to EventBus
3. Event payloads contain the expected data
