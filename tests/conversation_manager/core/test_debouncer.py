"""
Tests for the Debouncer utility.

The Debouncer manages async task execution with queue-of-2 debouncing:
- Pending task replacement (debouncing)
- Running tasks always complete; only the pending slot is replaced
- At most 1 running + 1 pending

These tests verify the Debouncer's behavior independent of the
ConversationManager integration.

NOTE: Debouncer tests are inherently timing-sensitive since the debouncer
manages task timing. Some fixed sleeps are intentional to test the debounce
behavior (e.g., simulating LLM thinking time). Where possible, we use
event-based synchronization for task coordination.
