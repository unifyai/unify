tests/conversation_manager/core/test_boot_hydration_gate.py
===========================================================

Symbolic tests for the boot hydration render gate: a slow-brain turn
requested while boot hydration is still in flight must hold until the
conversation is loaded from the chat table, so the first reply after a
restart never renders an empty view of a conversation whose history is
seconds from landing.

The production shape being reproduced: converse (every message is written
to the chat table), the process exits, a new process boots over the same
store, and an inbound lands immediately — before ``hydrate_chat_history``
has restored the prior conversation. These tests rebuild that window at
the component level: the gate closed exactly as ``init_conv_manager``
closes it, the inbound stepped in, and hydration run through the real
``run_boot_hydration`` wrapper — asserting the ordering contract without
spinning full manager init a second time.
