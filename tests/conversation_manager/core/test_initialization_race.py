===========================================================

Integration tests for manager initialization race conditions.

These tests verify the system correctly handles events that arrive BEFORE or
DURING manager initialization:
- Chat messages can arrive immediately after the session boots
- The chat table is bound part-way through initialization
- Multiple events can arrive in rapid succession

Events arriving before initialization is complete must not fail silently.
These tests verify:
- queue_operation correctly defers work until after initialization
- Chat messages that arrive before the chat table is bound are kept
- Multiple rapid events don't cause race conditions
