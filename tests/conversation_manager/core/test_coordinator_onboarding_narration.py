"""Unit tests for the coordinator onboarding reset narration.

``_coordinator_onboarding_notification_text`` is a pure function that turns
one ``CoordinatorOnboardingEvent`` into the brain-facing instruction string.
The reset subtype is the one that must tell the brain a step is no longer
done so a later nudge cannot claim it complete.
