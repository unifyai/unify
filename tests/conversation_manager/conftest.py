==============================================

Fixtures for conversation manager integration tests.

Uses **direct handler testing** pattern (same as ContactManager tests):
- No event-driven initialization (no background task dependencies)
- Direct calls to event handlers via CMStepDriver
- Direct state inspection
- Works reliably with pytest-asyncio

These tests use **simulated** state managers (SimulatedActor,
SimulatedContactManager, SimulatedTranscriptManager) to avoid real LLM
calls and computer environment dependencies. The brain tools route
directly to ContactManager/TranscriptManager (ask_about_contacts,
update_contacts, query_past_transcripts), so those must also be simulated.

Parallel execution is coordinated using scenario_file_lock (same pattern as
ContactManager tests) to prevent race conditions when multiple test processes
try to create system contacts simultaneously.
