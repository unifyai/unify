tests/conversation_manager/conftest.py
==============================================

Fixtures for conversation manager integration tests.

Uses **direct handler testing** pattern:
- No event-driven initialization (no background task dependencies)
- Direct calls to event handlers via CMStepDriver
- Direct state inspection
- Works reliably with pytest-asyncio

The actor is simulated so the only real LLM calls are the slow brain's own.
