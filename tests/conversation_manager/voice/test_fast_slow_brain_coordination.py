tests/conversation_manager/voice/test_fast_slow_brain_coordination.py
======================================================================

Tests for coordination between the fast brain (Voice Agent) and slow brain
(Main CM Brain) during voice calls.

Architecture Overview:
----------------------
- **Slow Brain** (Main CM Brain / ConversationManager): Handles orchestration,
  task execution, and cross-channel communication. Runs in the main process.

- **Fast Brain** (Voice Agent): Lightweight LLM in a subprocess that handles
  real-time voice conversation. Runs in medium_scripts/call.py.

What This File Tests:
---------------------
1. **Decision boundaries**: When should the slow brain provide guidance vs stay silent?
2. **Guidance content**: Is guidance appropriate (data/notifications) vs inappropriate
   (conversational steering)?
3. **Coordination timing**: Does the slow brain avoid duplicating what the fast brain
   already handles autonomously?
4. **Schema correctness**: Do the response models allow the intended behavior?
5. **Rapid utterance handling**: Does the slow brain complete thinking even with
   rapid user turns?
6. **Stale guidance filtering**: Does the system filter out guidance that's no longer
   relevant because the conversation moved on?

Key Principle (per system prompt in prompt_builders.py):
--------------------------------------------------------
The slow brain's `call_guidance` field should ONLY be used for:
- Providing data: "The meeting time the boss mentioned earlier was 3pm on Thursday"
- Requesting data: "Please ask for their preferred contact method"
- Notifications: "The boss just confirmed via SMS that the budget is approved"

It should NOT be used for:
- Steering the conversation
- Suggesting responses or dialogue
- Providing conversational guidance
- Micromanaging the Voice Agent's approach

The Voice Agent independently handles ALL conversational aspects including greetings.

Known Issue (duplicate speech bug):
-----------------------------------
When a call starts, the slow brain may provide conversational guidance like
"Greet Ved warmly" even though the fast brain has already greeted the user
autonomously. This causes duplicate speech. Tests in this file document and
verify the fix for this issue.

Known Issue (rapid utterance cancellation):
-------------------------------------------
When user turns occur faster than the slow brain can think, every new utterance
cancels the in-flight LLM run (because interject_or_run uses cancel_running=True).
This means the slow brain NEVER completes thinking if the user keeps talking.
Tests in this file document and verify the fix for this issue.

Known Issue (stale guidance after topic change):
------------------------------------------------
When the user changes topics while the slow brain is thinking, the slow brain's
guidance may be about the OLD topic. Without filtering, this stale guidance is
sent to the fast brain, causing confusing out-of-context speech.
Tests in this file document and verify the fix for this issue.

        This test documents the bug reported by Ved and verifies the fix:

        BUG (before fix):
        - Inbound call starts
        - Slow brain runs immediately via request_llm_run(delay=0)
        - Slow brain sees "Call started" notification
        - Slow brain outputs call_guidance: "Greet Ved warmly..."

        FIX:
        - Inbound call starts
        - Slow brain does NOT run on call start (is_outbound=False)
        - Fast brain handles greeting autonomously
        - Slow brain only runs later when there's actual content to process
