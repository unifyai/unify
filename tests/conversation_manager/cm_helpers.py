=============================================

Shared helper functions for ConversationManager tests.

These helpers are specific to the event-driven testing paradigm used by
ConversationManager tests, where we step through events and filter output
events by type. Other managers (ContactManager, TranscriptManager) use
a different paradigm (direct async tool loop with single return values)
and don't need these helpers.
