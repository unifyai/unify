"""Whether a real model writes a usable correction for running code.

The machinery is covered symbolically in ``test_live_steering``. What is not
covered there is the judgement the mechanism now depends on: given a running
block, a correction in plain English, and a list of what has already happened,
does the model produce a patch that changes the right thing and repeats
nothing?

Real LLM calls, cached per unique input like everywhere else in the suite.
Assertions are on the *outcome* — which sends happened — rather than on the
text of the patch, because there are many correct rewrites and only one
correct set of side effects.
