"""
Interjection behaviours for the async tool loop (live-handle path).

Covers:
- Injecting extra user messages that trigger additional tool calls.
- Preservation and placement of interjections relative to tool results.
- Pre-empting/interrupting LLM turns with interjections.
- Graceful stop via handle.stop().
- Immediate placeholder insertion and backfill of missing tool replies.
