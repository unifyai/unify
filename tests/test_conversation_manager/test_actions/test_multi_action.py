tests/test_conversation_manager/test_multi_action.py
====================================================

Tests that verify ConversationManager correctly handles multiple concurrent
`act` requests and disambiguates when to create new actions vs steer existing ones.

These tests build upon test_take_action.py and test_steer_action.py to cover
more complex realistic scenarios involving:
- Multiple concurrent in-flight actions
- Disambiguating new actions vs interjections to existing actions
- Steering specific actions when multiple are running
- Sequential action creation with context

Uses SimulatedActor under the hood with configurable `steps` to ensure
actions remain in-flight long enough for multi-action scenarios.
