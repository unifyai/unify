"""
End-to-end tests for the *control-tool* extension of
`unify.common.async_tool_loop._async_tool_use_loop_inner`.

What we verify
--------------

* **Continue** – A long-running tool is launched, the user interjects asking
  the assistant to *keep waiting*; the loop must *not* start a second copy of
  that tool.

* **Stop** – The user interjects asking to *stop* the running tool; the
  task is aborted, no tool-result message appears, and the control decision is
  omitted from the permanent chat transcript.

As with the other suites we talk to a **live model** – make sure you have
internet connectivity and `OPENAI_API_KEY` (or proxy equivalent) configured.
