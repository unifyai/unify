"""How the loop tallies refused calls, and when it stops.

A refusal is how a caller converges on an argspec: it is told what is wrong and
tries again. Counting refusals the way unexpected exceptions are counted would
abort exactly that. So refusals end the loop only on repetition — the same call
sent again unchanged, or the same complaint earned while something irrelevant is
varied around it.
