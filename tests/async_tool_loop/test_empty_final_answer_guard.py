"""Loop-level tests for two finalization defects in the async tool loop.

Both are exercised with a fully scripted fake in place of
``generate_with_preprocess`` (no LLM calls, no network) driving a real
``start_async_tool_loop``.

1. A flag that guarantees "one more turn after a late-arriving tool result"
   must not survive past the dispatch that already carries that result in
   its prompt — otherwise a stale flag forces a spurious extra turn after
   the real answer, and that extra turn's empty content can silently
   replace it.
2. When a terminal turn's own content is empty, finalization must fall back
   to the last substantive assistant content already in the transcript
   instead of returning it verbatim; and when no substantive content exists
   anywhere, it must retry with a nudge before failing loudly, never
   returning a silent empty result.
