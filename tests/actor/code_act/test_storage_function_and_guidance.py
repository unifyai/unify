"""Storage-loop integration tests for FunctionManager + GuidanceManager.

Tests the storage check loop's discrimination between the two stores:

* ``test_storage_loop_stores_both_function_and_guidance`` — a multi-step
  pipeline with reusable utilities AND a non-trivial composition.
  Expected: function(s) stored in FM, workflow guidance stored in GM.

* ``test_storage_loop_stores_function_without_guidance`` — a single
  well-parameterized utility with no multi-step composition.
  Expected: function stored in FM, NO guidance created in GM.

This complements the existing storage tests in ``test_can_compose_and_store.py``
which only assert on FunctionManager storage.
