"""Tests for the StorageCheck-completion wake signal.

``_StorageCheckHandle._run_lifecycle`` Phase 2 enqueues a
``storage_review_complete`` notification right before the handle's
completion event flips (see ``code_act_actor.py``). Two things must hold:

* A watcher that only re-checks ``handle.done()`` between notifications can
  race that flip and drop the notification unless the consumer
  (``actor_watch_notifications``) explicitly drains the queue -- this is
  the "drain race" described in the tech plan.
* The failure path (the storage loop raising) must still emit the signal,
  with ``success=False`` and the error text, never skip it silently.
