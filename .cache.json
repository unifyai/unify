The following function takes care of edge cases, such as when the list is too short or when `n` is not within a valid range. Here's the implementation:\\n\\n```python\\ndef nth_largest_number(lst, n):\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"\\n    Find the nth largest number in a list.\\n\\n    :param lst: List of numbers\\n    :param n: The \\\"n\\\" to identify the nth largest element\\n    :return: The nth largest number in the list if it exists, otherwise None\\n    :raises: ValueError if n is not a valid position\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"\\n\\n    if not lst:\\n        raise ValueError(\\\"List is empty\\\")\\n\\n    if n <= 0 or n > len(lst):\\n        raise ValueError(\\\"n must be a positive integer less than or equal to the length of the list\\\")\\n\\n    # Sort the list in descending order\\n    sorted_lst = sorted(lst, reverse=True)\\n\\n    # Return the nth largest element\\n    return sorted_lst[n - 1]\\n\\n# Example usage:\\n# lst = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6, 5, 3, 5]\\n# result = nth_largest_number(lst, 3)\\n# print(result)  # Output should be 5\\n```\\n\\n### Explanation:\\n\\n1. **Function Definition**: The function `nth_largest_number` accepts a list `lst` and an integer `n`.\\n\\n2. **Edge Case Check**:\\n   - The function checks if the list is empty and raises a `ValueError` if so.\\n   - It ensures that `n` is a valid index by checking if `n` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to the length of the list.\\n\\n3. **Sorting**: The list is sorted in descending order. We use the `sorted()` function with `reverse=True` to get a descending order.\\n\\n4. **Returning Result**: The function returns the `(n-1)` index of the sorted list to obtain the nth largest value.\\n\\n5. **Example Usage**: A sample usage scenario is provided in the comments for clarity.\\n\\nThis implementation efficiently finds the nth largest number and handles common edge cases by validating inputs.\", \"refusal\": null, \"role\": \"assistant\", \"audio\": null, \"function_call\": null, \"tool_calls\": null}}], \"created\": 1739954855, \"model\": \"gpt-4o@openai\", \"object\": \"chat.completion\", \"service_tier\": null, \"system_fingerprint\": null, \"usage\": {\"completion_tokens\": 481, \"prompt_tokens\": 90, \"total_tokens\": 571, \"completion_tokens_details\": {\"accepted_prediction_tokens\": 0, \"audio_tokens\": 0, \"reasoning_tokens\": 0, \"rejected_prediction_tokens\": 0}, \"prompt_tokens_details\": {\"audio_tokens\": 0, \"cached_tokens\": 0}, \"cost\": 0.005035}}", "chat.completions.create_{\"model\": \"gpt-4o@openai\", \"messages\": [{\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"You are an expert software engineer, write the code asked of you to the highest quality.
