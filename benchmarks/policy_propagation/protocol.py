"""Shared protocol for the policy propagation experiment.

Three verbal requests set up three recurring automations over the same
inquiry stream, each stating the identical escalation policy verbatim. The
fire schedule: every automation fires twice under the initial policy, then
ONE natural-language policy-update message is delivered, then every
automation fires three more times — scored against the updated policy.

What this measures: where each architecture put the shared policy, what one
change costs to apply, and — the reliability number — whether every
automation actually behaves per the updated policy afterwards. A stale copy
anywhere shows up as wrong priorities/counts on that automation's
post-change fires.
