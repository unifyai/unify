"""Shared protocol for the drift-recovery experiment.

Both arms receive the identical utterance, the identical fire schedule, and
the identical scoring. A "fire" is: release ORDERS_PER_FIRE new orders into
the stream, trigger the system's recurring automation once, then score
whatever landed at the sink against ground truth for the pending seq range.
Drift (the ``unit_price_cents`` → ``unit_price_minor`` rename) is applied
after DRIFT_AFTER_FIRE fires have completed.

Please set up an hourly recurring automation that processes new orders from \

How it works: GET {base_url}/batches/last returns {{"last_seq": N}} — the \
highest order seq already processed (0 if none yet). \
GET {base_url}/orders?after=N returns the next orders with seq > N (up to \
200), each with fields: seq (int), date (YYYY-MM-DD), region, units (int), \
unit_price_cents (int).

On each run: read last_seq, fetch the orders after it, and if there are none \
do nothing. Otherwise compute exactly: batch_start_seq, batch_end_seq, \
order_count, total_units, total_revenue_cents (sum of units * \
unit_price_cents), revenue_by_region_cents (object mapping each region to \
its revenue sum), and POST that JSON object to {base_url}/batches with \
exactly these keys.

Set up the recurring hourly automation now. Do not process anything right \
now, and do not ask for confirmation.\
