# Screen Share Manager – Controlled Analysis Flow

The `ScreenShareManager` is a stateful component responsible for analyzing real-time screen share video and user speech to detect and annotate meaningful events. It is designed to be directly instantiated and controlled by a consuming manager (like `ConversationManager`).

Implementation lives in `unity/screen_share_manager/`; representative tests live in `tests/test_screen_share_manager/`.

## Motivation and Design

This manager follows a direct-control model. The consumer is responsible for its lifecycle (`start`/`stop`) and for explicitly defining the boundaries of an analysis "turn" using `start_turn()` and `end_turn()`. This design offers several key advantages:

-   **Explicit Turn Control:** The consumer has full authority over when an analysis turn begins and ends. This allows for complex turns containing multiple speech utterances or specific visual interactions, eliminating ambiguity about what events belong together.
-   **Clear Ownership:** The flow of data is explicit. The consumer drives the analysis, making the system's behavior predictable and easy to reason about.
-   **Testability:** The manager can be tested in complete isolation without dependencies on infrastructure like Redis.
-   **Performance:** The architecture is optimized for concurrency, preventing the consumer from being blocked by slow analysis tasks.

## Core Architectural Pattern: The Two-Stage Flow

To maximize performance and responsiveness, the analysis process is decoupled into two distinct stages: a fast **detection** stage and an on-demand **annotation** stage.

### Stage 1: Fast Event Detection

The first stage quickly identifies *potential* moments of interest from all the events collected during a turn.

1.  The consumer calls `manager.start_turn()` to begin a new analysis window.
2.  The consumer pushes a stream of video frames (`push_frame`) and one or more speech events (`push_speech`) into the manager. These are collected but not yet analyzed.
3.  When the consumer decides the turn is complete, it calls `manager.end_turn()`. This call is non-blocking and immediately returns an `asyncio.Task`.
4.  This task internally triggers a lightweight, text-based LLM analysis on the timeline of events collected during the turn. It may be enriched with opportunistic, auto-generated captions for visual events to improve accuracy.
5.  When awaited, the task resolves to a `List[DetectedEvent]`. A `DetectedEvent` is a simple data object containing a timestamp and a pending `ImageHandle` for the relevant screenshot.

### Stage 2: On-Demand Contextual Annotation

The second stage generates rich, user-facing descriptions for the events identified in Stage 1.

1.  The consumer receives the `List[DetectedEvent]` from Stage 1.
2.  It then calls `manager.annotate_events(events, context: Optional[str] = None)`. The consumer can **optionally** provide its own high-level context (e.g., "The user was trying to log in").
3.  This method performs the expensive, high-quality vision LLM call. It intelligently combines its own internal, long-term `session_summary` with the optional, immediate context from the consumer to generate the most relevant annotations.
4.  It attaches the generated annotation string to the `.annotation` property of the original `ImageHandle` objects and returns the now-enriched list of handles.

## End-to-End Consumer Example

This example shows how a consumer would use the manual turn-based API.

```python
from __future__ import annotations
import asyncio

from unity.screen_share_manager.screen_share_manager import ScreenShareManager

async def run_consumer_workflow():
    # 1. Consumer instantiates and starts the manager
    screen_manager = ScreenShareManager()
    await screen_manager.start()
    screen_manager.set_session_context("User is attempting to navigate a web portal.")

    # In a real system, frame pushing happens in a background loop.
    
    # --- Stage 1: Detection (Driven by Manual Turn Control) ---
    
    # 2. Consumer starts a turn
    screen_manager.start_turn()
    print("Turn started. Manager is now collecting events.")
    
    # 3. User speaks multiple times. The manager collects these events for the turn.
    await screen_manager.push_speech("Okay, I see the login form.", 10.0, 11.5)
    await asyncio.sleep(2) # User performs some actions
    await screen_manager.push_speech("Now I'm clicking the 'Submit' button.", 14.0, 15.0)

    # 4. Consumer ends the turn and triggers analysis. This is non-blocking.
    analysis_task = screen_manager.end_turn()
    print("Turn ended. Detection task for the collected events has started...")

    detected_events = await analysis_task
    if not detected_events:
        print("No key events were detected in this turn.")
        await screen_manager.stop()
        return

    print(f"Detected {len(detected_events)} candidate event(s).")

    # --- Stage 2: Annotation (Concurrent) ---
    annotation_context = "The user is filling out a profile form and just stated their intent to submit."
    final_annotated_handles = await screen_manager.annotate_events(
        detected_events, annotation_context
    )

    for handle in final_annotated_handles:
        print(f"  - Image (Pending ID: {handle.image_id}): {handle.annotation}")

    # 5. Clean up
    await screen_manager.stop()

```

## Public API Reference

-   `start() -> Awaitable[None]`: Starts all internal background tasks. Must be called before any other methods.
-   `stop() -> Awaitable[None]`: Signals all background tasks to shut down gracefully.
-   `set_session_context(context_text: str) -> None`: Sets the initial long-term context for the session.
-   `push_frame(frame_b64: str, timestamp: float) -> Awaitable[None]`: Pushes a single video frame into the processing queue.
-   `push_speech(content: str, start_time: float, end_time: float) -> Awaitable[None]`: Pushes a user utterance. If a turn is active (`start_turn` was called), this utterance is collected for the turn's analysis.
-   `start_turn() -> None`: Manually begins a new analysis turn. The manager will collect all subsequent speech and visual events until `end_turn()` is called.
-   `end_turn() -> asyncio.Task[List[DetectedEvent]]`: Ends the current turn and triggers the fast detection stage on all collected events. It returns a task that the consumer must `await` to get the list of candidate `DetectedEvent` objects.
-   `annotate_events(events: List[DetectedEvent], context: str) -> Awaitable[List[ImageHandle]]`: Triggers the expensive annotation process for the given events and returns the list of handles, which will have their `.annotation` property populated upon completion.

## Key Features and Mechanics

The manager uses a robust set of internal patterns to handle real-time streams efficiently:

-   **Concurrent and Ordered Processing:** Incoming frames are pushed into a queue and processed by a pool of worker threads. A dedicated `_sequencer` task reassembles the processed frames in their original order, ensuring that visual change detection operates on a correct timeline, even if individual frames take different amounts of time to process.

-   **Adaptive Frame Dropping:** To prevent memory backlogs during high-activity periods, the manager monitors its internal frame queue. If the queue becomes too full, it proactively drops incoming frames until the processing workers can catch up, prioritizing system stability over processing every single frame.

-   **Multi-Stage Visual Change Detection:** A simple, fast heuristic (Mean Squared Error) is used to quickly reject identical or nearly-identical frames. Frames that pass this initial check are then subjected to more sophisticated, perceptually-aware algorithms (like Structural Similarity Index and histogram correlation) to determine if the change is significant enough to be considered a potential event.

-   **Burst Event Consolidation:** To reduce noise from animations or rapid UI transitions, the manager groups consecutive visual events that occur within a short time window into a single "burst." Instead of reporting every frame of an animation, it intelligently samples the burst, typically focusing on the final, stable frame as the representative moment for the entire sequence.

-   **Opportunistic Auto-Captioning for Detection:** To improve the accuracy of the detection stage, the manager enriches the context sent to the detection LLM. When a candidate visual event is identified, it immediately creates an `ImageHandle` with `auto_caption=True`. This kicks off a non-blocking background task to generate a simple caption. The detection pipeline does *not* wait for this task. When it's time to call the detection LLM, it checks if any captions have already resolved. If so, it includes them in the prompt (e.g., "A 'Success' modal appeared"), allowing the LLM to use semantic information in its decision. If not, the system gracefully falls back to using generic timestamp data, providing an accuracy boost without sacrificing latency.

-   **Rolling Session Summary:** The manager maintains a long-term, narrative summary of the session. After each turn's annotations are generated, a separate, lightweight LLM call updates this summary to incorporate the new events, ensuring that future analysis has a coherent and up-to-date backstory.

-   **Multi-Layered Annotation Context:** The annotation prompt is dynamically built from multiple sources to provide the richest possible context to the vision LLM. It includes:
    1.  The long-term **session summary**.
    2.  The immediate **consumer context** provided in the `annotate_events` call.
    3.  A list of **previous annotations** from within the current turn, creating a narrative flow.
    4.  A list of the most **recent key events** from previous turns.

-   **Explicit Turns and Inactivity Flushing:** While turns are primarily controlled via `start_turn`/`end_turn`, the manager includes a safety net. If visual events are detected without any accompanying speech (a "silent turn"), they are temporarily held. If no new turn is started after a configurable timeout, these pending silent events are automatically flushed for detection to ensure they are not lost.
