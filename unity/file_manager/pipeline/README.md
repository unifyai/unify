## `pipeline/` — shared pipeline infrastructure

This package owns the reusable infrastructure for file parsing and ingestion pipelines: typed transport models, artifact storage, observability ledgers, resilience policies, work queues, and deployment bundle orchestration.

It sits below `managers/` and `parse_adapter/` in the dependency graph and above no other `file_manager` subpackage. All of the types and protocols defined here are designed to be consumed by the FileManager executor, by deployment bundle workflows, and eventually by dedicated parse/ingest workers on GCP.

## Design principles

- **Ports and Adapters**: every infrastructure concern (artifact storage, work queues, run/cost ledgers, deployment stores) is expressed as a `Protocol` with a local-first implementation. GCP-backed adapters live in the private deployment repos and plug into the same protocols.
- **Control plane is JSON**: manifests, queue messages, ledger records, and progress events are all JSON-serializable Pydantic models. Large tabular data is never serialized through the control plane.
- **No pickle**: binary serialization on durable or cross-process boundaries is explicitly forbidden. Row data stays in its original source file or is materialized as JSONL/Parquet artifacts.
- **Typed settings**: all configuration flows through Pydantic `BaseSettings` models defined in `types/config.py`. No ad-hoc `os.getenv()` calls.

## Module inventory

### `types.py` — typed transport models

Defines the sealed `TableInputHandle` union for deferred row loading:

```
TableInputHandle (discriminated union)
  ├── InlineRowsHandle      — small tables with rows materialized in memory
  ├── CsvFileHandle          — pointer to a CSV file + dialect metadata
  ├── XlsxSheetHandle        — pointer to an XLSX sheet + header metadata
  └── ObjectStoreArtifactHandle — pointer to a materialized JSONL/Parquet artifact
```

Also defines `ParsedFileBundle`, the pipeline-owned wrapper that pairs a semantic `FileParseResult` with a dict of `TableInputHandle`s keyed by table ID.

The key invariant: `ExtractedTable` stays a pure semantic DTO. Transport and persistence concerns live exclusively in `TableInputHandle` and `ParsedFileBundle`.

### `artifact_store.py` — durable artifact materialization

`ArtifactStore` protocol and `LocalArtifactStore` (filesystem-backed). Given any `TableInputHandle`, the store materializes rows into a durable artifact and returns an `ObjectStoreArtifactHandle`.

The local implementation writes JSONL files under a content-addressed path. Future GCP implementation writes to GCS and returns `gs://` URIs.

### `run_ledger.py` — run lifecycle manifests

Typed models for tracking pipeline run lifecycle:

- `PipelineRunManifest`: top-level run record with `run_id`, status, timing
- `PipelineFileManifest`: per-file record within a run
- `PipelineStageManifest`: per-stage timing and error tracking

`RunLedger` protocol with `JsonlRunLedger` implementation that appends manifests as JSONL records for post-run inspection.

### `cost_ledger.py` — per-run cost estimation

Rate-card-based cost estimation with typed line items:

- `PipelineCostRateCard`: versioned unit rates for compute, storage, ingest, embeddings, observability
- `PipelineCostLineItem`: one cost entry (component, quantity, unit_rate, estimated_cost, confidence)
- `PipelineCostLedger`: per-run cost summary with all line items
- `PipelineCostAccumulator`: mutable collector used during pipeline execution

Builder functions (`build_parse_cost_line_items`, `build_ingest_cost_line_items`, etc.) accept pre-computed metrics and produce line items. The accumulator finalizes into a `PipelineCostLedger` at run completion.

`CostLedger` protocol with `JsonlCostLedger` for local JSONL persistence.

### `retry_policy.py` — network resilience

`ResilientRequestPolicy` encapsulates retry logic for network boundaries:

- configurable max retries, backoff multiplier, jitter ratio, deadline budget
- typed `FailureKind` classification (retryable, permanent, rate-limited, timeout)
- `RetryDecision` with computed delay

Applied consistently to Orchestra HTTP calls, artifact store operations, and queue interactions.

### `work_queue.py` — typed work queue

`WorkQueue` protocol for queue-backed parse/ingest orchestration:

- `publish(topic, payload)` → message ID
- `receive(max_messages, topics)` → leased `ReceivedWorkItem`s
- `ack(receipt_id)` / `retry(receipt_id, error, delay)` / `dead_letter(receipt_id, error)`

`InMemoryWorkQueue` is the local implementation backed by `asyncio.Queue`, following the same async patterns used by `EventBus` and `ConversationManager`. `LocalQueueWorker` drains items with automatic ack/retry/dead-letter routing based on handler exceptions.

Dead-lettered items are retained in memory for operator inspection via the `dead_letters` property.

### `deployment/` — offline deployment bundle ingestion

Subpackage for typed client data-dump ingestion. See [`deployment/README.md`](deployment/README.md).

### `_utils.py` — shared internal helpers

Private module with `utc_now()`, `utc_now_iso()`, and `JsonlWriter` used across ledger and deployment modules. Not part of the public API.

## End-to-end data flow

```
FileParser.parse() → FileParseResult (semantic, public)
       ↓
ParsedFileBundle (pipeline-owned: result + TableInputHandles)
       ↓
FileManager executor (ingest via DataManager, emit ledgers)
       ↓
ArtifactStore (optional materialization for large tables)
       ↓
RunLedger + CostLedger (JSONL persistence for inspection)
```

For deployment bundles, the flow is:

```
DeploymentBundle manifest
       ↓
LocalDeploymentBundleStore.prepare_bundle() (stage artifacts)
       ↓
LocalDeploymentIngestionRunner.submit() (background execution)
       ↓
execute callback (parse + ingest with stage reporting)
       ↓
DeploymentIngestionJob (status, stages, cost, observability refs)
```

## Extending with GCP adapters

The Ports and Adapters design means GCP implementations plug in without changing pipeline logic:

| Port | Local implementation | GCP implementation (private repo) |
|------|---------------------|-----------------------------------|
| `ArtifactStore` | `LocalArtifactStore` | `GcsArtifactStore` |
| `WorkQueue` | `InMemoryWorkQueue` | `PubSubWorkQueue` / `CloudTasksWorkQueue` |
| `RunLedger` | `JsonlRunLedger` | Cloud Logging / BigQuery |
| `CostLedger` | `JsonlCostLedger` | BigQuery cost export |
| `DeploymentBundleStore` | `LocalDeploymentBundleStore` | `GcsDeploymentBundleStore` |
| `DeploymentJobStore` | `LocalDeploymentJobStore` | Firestore / Cloud SQL |
