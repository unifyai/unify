"""Ingest-related type definitions for DataManager.

This module defines Pydantic models for configuring and reporting the
results of :meth:`DataManager.ingest` operations.

Terminology
-----------
* **Ingest (narrow):** Create a table context and insert rows. No parsing,
  no embedding. This is the core behaviour of ``DataManager.ingest()``.
* **Embed:** Create vector embeddings for text columns. A separate, optional
  step within ``ingest()`` that only runs when ``embed_columns`` is provided.

See Also
--------
DataManager.ingest : The public method these types support.
DataManager.create_table : Low-level table creation.
DataManager.insert_rows : Low-level row insertion.

class AutoDerivedColumn(BaseModel):

    All fields in the context matching ``source_type`` get a derived
    column whose name is built from the source field name and
    ``target_suffix`` via :func:`_derive_target_name`.

    ``target_suffix`` is a **semantic word or phrase** (e.g. ``"Date"``,
    ``"duration seconds"``), *not* a literal string to concatenate.  The
    separator and casing are inferred from each source field's naming
    convention so that a single suffix adapts to heterogeneous field
    styles within the same context:

    +--------------------------+--------+------------------------------+
    | Source field              | Suffix | Derived target name          |

class IngestExecutionConfig(BaseModel):
    """Advanced execution options for :meth:`DataManager.ingest`.

    These settings control the internal pipeline engine that ``ingest()``
    uses for chunked parallel row insertion and embedding.  Default values
    are suitable for most workloads; tweak them for very large datasets or
    rate-limited backends.

    Attributes
    ----------
    max_workers : int
        Maximum threads used for concurrent chunk processing (insertion and
        embedding).  Higher values increase throughput at the cost of more
        backend pressure.  Default ``4``.
    max_retries : int
        Number of retry attempts per failed chunk before giving up.
        Uses exponential backoff (see *retry_delay_seconds*).  Default ``3``.
    retry_delay_seconds : float
        Base delay between retries in seconds.  Actual delay is
        ``retry_delay_seconds * 2 ** (attempt - 1)``.  Default ``3.0``.
    fail_fast : bool
        If ``True``, stop the pipeline on the first chunk failure rather
        than attempting remaining chunks.  Default ``False``.
    insert_parallelism : Literal["auto", "serial", "parallel"]
        Controls whether insert chunks are chained or fanned out after table
        creation.  ``"auto"`` (default) serializes only when ``auto_counting``
        is configured, ``"serial"`` always chains inserts, and ``"parallel"``
        forces fan-out for callers willing to trade deterministic batch order
        for throughput.
    embedding_batch_size : int
        Maximum number of row IDs sent in a single embedding-derived-column
        request.  Large ``embed_strategy="after"`` runs are split into batches
        of this size so one giant request does not become the throughput
        bottleneck.  Default ``1000``.

    --------

        The Unify context path that was written to.
    rows_inserted : int
        Total number of rows successfully inserted across all chunks.

    log_ids : list[int]
        Backend log IDs for each ``insert_rows`` call (useful for auditing).

    chunks_processed : int
