"""Actor execution environment for CodeActActor.

Provides ``primitives.actor.act()`` in the sandbox for spawning isolated
inner CodeActActors for focused sub-tasks.  Lives under the unified
``primitives`` namespace alongside state managers and computer control.

Stored functions that call ``primitives.actor.act(...)`` work through the
standard ``depends_on`` pipeline: detected at storage time by
``DependencyVisitor``, injected at runtime by ``_inject_dependencies``
via ``construct_sandbox_root("primitives")`` → ``Primitives()``.  This
is why ``_ActorRunner`` must be fully stateless (no ContextVars, no
parent state).

        """Spawn an actor to work on a focused sub-task.

        The actor is an independent CodeActActor with its own sandbox,
        prompt, and (optionally) a curated set of directly callable
        functions.  It returns a steerable handle, allowing the caller
        to monitor progress and steer (stop, pause, resume, interject) the
        actor mid-flight.

        Actors are **steerable** — once spawned, dynamic steering helpers
        appear (stop, pause, resume, interject) so you can monitor progress and
        redirect the actor mid-flight, just like any other steerable handle.

        When to use
        -----------
        - The overall task decomposes naturally into independent sub-problems
          that benefit from focused, isolated reasoning.
        - A sub-task requires multi-step work that would clutter or distract
          the main agent's context window.
        - You want to isolate a sub-task's execution state (sessions,
          variables) from the main agent's sandbox.
        - You want to keep the main agent's context clean for high-level
          orchestration.

        When NOT to use
        ---------------
        - The task is simple enough to handle directly with ``execute_code``.
        - You need intermediate results from the sub-task to inform logic in
          the same code block (use ``execute_code`` with stateful sessions).
        - The sub-task is trivial (single tool call) — the overhead of an
          actor is not worth it.

        Best practices
        --------------
        - Write a **clear, self-contained request description**. The actor
          does not see the parent's conversation or sandbox state. Include
          all relevant context in the request string.
        - Use **guidelines** to inject persistent behavioral directives
          (e.g., "Be extremely thorough", "Respond in JSON") that the
          actor must follow throughout its session.
        - Use **prompt_guidance** to pass specific procedural guides from
          the GuidanceManager that the actor should follow.
        - Set an appropriate **timeout** for the expected complexity.

        Parameters
        ----------
        request : str
            A clear, self-contained description of what the actor should
            accomplish. Be specific and include all necessary context, because
            the actor does **not** share the parent agent's conversation
            history or session state.
        guidelines : str, optional
            Persistent behavioral directives injected into the actor's
            system prompt. Unlike the request (which describes *what* to
            do), guidelines describe *how* to behave throughout the
            session — e.g., output format, thoroughness level, tone, or
            constraints. When omitted, no additional guidelines are set.
        prompt_guidance : list[str | int], optional
            Guidance entries to resolve from the GuidanceManager and
            inject into the actor's system prompt.  Each element is
            either a guidance **title** (``str``) or a **guidance_id**
            (``int``).  Resolved entries are formatted as Markdown and
            prepended to the ``guidelines`` section so the actor sees
            them as persistent behavioral context.

            Use this to pass curated procedural knowledge (step-by-step
            instructions, SOPs, composition strategies) to the actor
            without requiring it to discover them via search.

            Prompt-injected guidance entries are automatically excluded
            from the actor's GuidanceManager search/filter results, so
            they will not appear as duplicates during discovery.

            Example::

                prompt_guidance=["Excel Processing Guide", 42]

            When omitted, no guidance is injected and the actor relies
            on GuidanceManager discovery tools (subject to
            ``guidance_scope``).
        guidance_scope : str, optional
            A boolean filter expression that restricts which guidance
            entries the actor can discover via GuidanceManager
            search/filter (e.g., ``"'financial' in title"`` or
            ``"guidance_id < 100"``).

            Mirrors ``discovery_scope`` for functions.  When provided,
            only guidance matching this expression is visible to the
            actor's GuidanceManager tools.  When omitted, all stored
            guidance is discoverable.
        prompt_functions : list[str], optional
            Functions or environments to place directly in the actor's
            system prompt, making them immediately callable without any
            discovery step.

            Use this for the functions most critical to the sub-task —
            the ones you actively want the actor to reach for.
            Because they appear directly in the prompt, they receive the
            actor's full attention and are the first tools it will
            consider.

            Prompt-injected functions are automatically excluded from the
            actor's FunctionManager search index, so they will not
            appear as duplicate results during discovery.

            Names are resolved in two stages:

            1. **Parent environments** — if the name matches a custom
               environment namespace from the calling agent (e.g., a
               namespace registered via ``create_env("examplecorp", ...)``),
               that environment is forwarded directly to the actor.
               The ``"primitives"`` namespace is never forwarded this
               way (it always resolves through the DB path).

            2. **FunctionManager DB** — remaining names use
               dotted-segment matching against function names stored in
               the database:

               - ``"primitives"`` — all primitives (state managers, computer, actor)
               - ``"primitives.contacts"`` — all contacts methods
               - ``"primitives.contacts.ask"`` — just contacts.ask
               - ``"primitives.computer"`` — all computer methods
               - ``"primitives.computer.desktop.act"`` — just desktop.act
               - ``"primitives.actor"`` — actor delegation
               - ``"alpha"`` — a specific stored function

            Any function stored in the database (primitives or
            compositional) can be listed here.
            Functions not listed are still discoverable via
            FunctionManager search (subject to ``discovery_scope``).

            When omitted, the actor receives no prompt-injected
            functions and relies entirely on FunctionManager discovery.
        discovery_scope : str, optional
            A boolean filter expression that restricts which functions
            the actor can discover via FunctionManager
            search/list/filter (e.g., ``"language == 'python'"`` or
            ``"'data' in docstring"``).

            When provided, only functions matching this expression are
            visible to the actor's discovery tools.  When omitted, all
            stored functions are discoverable.
        response_format : type (BaseModel subclass), optional
            A Pydantic ``BaseModel`` subclass that defines the required
            structure of the actor's final response.  When set, the
            actor is forced to submit its answer via a dedicated
            ``final_response`` tool whose schema matches the model.
            Validation failures are fed back to the actor so it can
            retry.  The caller receives a parsed Pydantic instance from
            ``await handle.result()``.
        timeout : float, optional
            Maximum seconds for the actor to complete.  When omitted
            the actor runs without a time limit.
        can_compose : bool, default True
            Whether the actor can write and execute arbitrary code via
            ``execute_code``. Set to False to restrict the actor to
            only discovering and executing stored functions.
        can_store : bool, default False
            Whether a post-completion review loop should run to identify
            and store reusable functions and guidance from the actor's
            trajectory. Storage is always deferred to a dedicated second
            loop after the main task completes.
        can_spawn_sub_agents : bool, default False
            Whether the actor can itself spawn deeper actors.
            Use with caution to avoid excessive nesting.
