    "\n"
    "## Strategy\n"
    "- Focus on the LARGEST and most verbose entries first — large tool results, "
    "full tracebacks, verbose assistant reasoning, extended thinking blocks. "
    "These yield the most savings.\n"
    "- Leave concise messages untouched. They cost nothing.\n"
    "- You may issue multiple `update` calls per turn (they execute in parallel).\n"

    "Keep the traceback only if later messages reference it.\n"
    "- Tool results: keep only data that was actually used or referenced later. "
    "Discard decorative formatting, repeated schema keys, and unreferenced fields.\n"
    "- Image tags (`[img:N]`): see the Images section below.\n"
    "- Thinking blocks: compress extended reasoning to key conclusions and "
    "decisions. Remove exploratory tangents that didn't affect the outcome.\n"
    "- Assistant messages with tool_calls: compact to tool names and key arguments.\n"
    '- Narration-only assistant text ("Let me look that up"): replace with the '
    "tool call summary. Keep reasoning text only if it informs later steps.\n"
    '- System messages (role "system"): preserve instructions faithfully. '
    "The exceptions are parent chat context sections "
    '("Parent Chat Context" headers) and compressed prior context sections '
    '("Compressed Prior Context" headers) — both can be heavily pruned '
